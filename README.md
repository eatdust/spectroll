# Spectroll: computing XYZ and friends

### Summary

Spectrol is a small python code for toying with CIE color standards.
From given spectra, you can compute colors in XYZ space and move to
other color spaces such as sRGB and wideGammutRGB.

### Installation

System install is supported with a basic `setup.py` script, but you
can also run the code straightaway. Two example programs are provided
**testrgb.py** and **testgaia.py** and can be run as

```
python testrgb.py
```

Have fun!
